So, if you try to set any width and height, it will have No effects. For example of inline elements are <span>, <a>, <img> etc. Inline-block element essentially the same thing as inline, except that you can set height and width values. Block element starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. For example, <div>, <h1>, <p>, <li> etc."
